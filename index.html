                <p>Howdy, coders!</p> 
                <p>I'm 25 years old self-educated web dev from Uzbekistan. Even though my major was not web development I fell in love with it and started digging a few years ago.
                After compleating several courses on <a href="https://sololearn.com" target="_blank">SoloLearn</a> everything started to make sense and I kind of knew what I was doing.</p>
                <p>The biggest impact in my learning curve though was defenitly <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>.

                <br><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ulugbek/front-end-libraries" target="_blank">Front End Libraries</a>
                <p>And here is some of my front end stuff on codepen:</p>
